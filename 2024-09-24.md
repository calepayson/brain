# SQLAlchemy Unified Tutorial

- [[SQLAlchemy]] consists of two APIs **Core** and **ORM**
	- Core is considered a broad database toolkit
	- ORM builds on the core to provide [[Object Relational Mapping]]
	- Object Relational Mapping means python classes can be mapped to database tables
## Overview
- Establishing connectivity
- Working with transactions and the dbapi
- Working with database metadata
- Working with data
- Data manipulation with the orm
- Working with ORM Related Objects

## Establishing Connectivity

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite+pysqlite:///:memory:", echo=True)
```

- The engine object is the central source of connections to a given database
- the `create_engine()` function creates a new database
	- It takes a string argument specifying:
		- the type of database
		- the DBAPI used (which is usually unnecessary)
		- the location of the database
- The engine object is lazy initialized. It will only try to connect to the database when it performs a task
## Working with Transactions and the DBAPI

### Getting a Connection
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

database_name = "test"

engine = create_engine(f"sqlite:///{database_name}.db")

with engine.connect() as conn:
	result = conn.execute(text("select 'hello world'"))
	print(result.all())
```
- An engine object helps connect to a database by providing a Connection object
- The Connection object is how all DB interactions are done.
- A Connection object is an open resource so it's important to limit it's use. The best way to do this is by using a with statement.
- A Connection doesn't commit automatically

### Committing Changes
```python
with engine.connect() as conn:
	conn.execute(text("CREATE TABLE some_table (x int, y int)"))
	conn.execute(
		text("INSERT INTO some_table (x, y) VALUES (:x, :y)"),
		[{"x": 1, "y": 1}, {"x": 2, "y": 4}],
	)
	conn.commit()
```
- the execute command "stages" a transaction. 
- the commit command saves it.
- There's an alternate method:
```python
with engine.connect() as conn:
	conn.execute(
		text("INSERT INTO some_table (x, y) VALUES (:x, :y)"),
		[{"x": 6, "y": 8}, {"x": 9, "y": 10}],
	)
```
- the begin once statement commits at the end of the with block automatically.
### Basics of Statement Execution
**Fetching  Rows**
```python
with engine.connect() as conn:
	result = conn.execute(text("SELECT x, y FROM some_table"))
	for row in result:
		print(f"x: {row.x} y: {row.y}")
```
- In this case the execute method returns a Result object
- The Result object is a list of Row objects
- Each Row object functions like a named tuple
	- Rows can be unpacked like tuples `x, y = Row(11, 12)`
	- each row is indexable `x = Row(11, 12)[0]`
	- Row fields can also be accessed by name `x = Row(11, 12).x`
