- **Phase I**: The Hand-Holding Honeymoon
	- Problem one is an overabundance of high hopes and expectations.
	- The entry to software engineering is a well trodden path with honed resources and advice.
	- This phase is resource dense.
- **Phase II**: The Cliff of Confusion
	- The hand holding stops and you become aware of all the things that were being simplified
	- Momentum is tough because it's hard to know where to go.
	- Knowledge scope increases by an order of magnitude in this phase
- **Phase III**: The Desert of Despair
	- Everything is repetitive.
	- It feels like you're making no progress.
	- Punctuated by mirages of competence.
- **Phase IV**: The Upswing of Awesome
	- You've found your way through the desert and now you can reliably build applications.
	- You've got a functional facade but under the hood is chaos.
